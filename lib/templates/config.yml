# -------------------
# This is your main configuration file for Palisade. It
# drives the backups run by Palisade. Edit this to your
# liking and then start backing up!
# -------------------
config:
  # -------------------
  # This is the root path to where your backups should be
  # stored.
  # 
  # This path should be accessible whenever the computer is
  # on. So, if it's an external drive, you'll need to make
  # sure it's always connected.
  # -------------------
  root: /path/to/my/backups
# -------------------
# This is where you store your backup settings. Each backup
# is broken down as a project, which can have assets (files)
# and a database. See the example below.
# -------------------
projects:
  # -------------------
  # The key should be a unique identifier for the project. 
  # -------------------
  my_first_project:
    # -------------------
    # `db` is the path to the database. If it is remote, use
    # a full ssh url. You can use ssh config shorthand
    # methods.
    # 
    # Note: You'll need a nightly dump of this database for
    # this to work.
    # -------------------
    db: myserver.com:~/backups/my_app_production.sql
    # -------------------
    # `assets` should stay as it is and have NO VALUE
    # -------------------
    assets:
      # -------------------
      # From here, you can add as many keys as you want, and
      # each can have their own remote ssh url. Each key
      # creates a segmented backup within this project.
      # 
      # Note: There should be no value for this key
      # -------------------
      files: 
        # -------------------
        # `method` is the method by which we're going to
        # back up the assets.
        # 
        # Options: rsync, s3cmd
        # 
        # You should make sure the method you're using is
        # installed on your machine.
        # -------------------
        method: rsync
        # -------------------
        # The route is the full path to the directory to
        # backup. For rsync, you can use shorthand methods.
        # -------------------
        route: deploy@192.168.1.1:~/apps/my_app/shared/files
      uploads: 
        # -------------------
        # This is an example that uses s3cmd to backup an
        # Amazon S3 bucket.
        # -------------------
        method: s3cmd
        # -------------------
        # When you use s3cmd, you can point to a custom
        # configuration file. If you leave this key blank
        # (or if it's missing), we assume the default
        # location.
        # -------------------
        config: ~/.mys3cfg
        # -------------------
        # Although s3cmd routes look this this:
        # 
        #     s3://mybucket/path/to/my/files/
        # 
        # You should omit the protocol, as we add that
        # automatically.
        # -------------------
        route: mybucket/
